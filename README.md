<h1 align="center">Java Console Chat Application</h1>.

<h3>This is a simple client-server **chat application** built in Java using **Sockets and Multithreading**. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages in real time via the command line or a GUI (optional). This project demonstrates the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking in Java, multi-threaded server design, and basic real-time message exchange between multiple clients and a server</h3>

## ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… Multi-client support via threads
- âœ… Message broadcasting to all connected clients
- âœ… Simple text interface (CLI)
- âœ… Optional GUI client (Java Swing)
- âœ… Graceful client disconnection

---
## âœ… How It Works

1. The **server** listens on port `2020` and spawns a new thread for each client connection.
2. Each **client** connects to the server using a TCP socket.
3. Clients and server exchange messages in real time.
4. If any participant types `bye`, their connection is gracefully closed.

### When prompted:

- **Enter Server IP Address**: Enter `127.0.0.1` if running on the same machine as the server, or provide the actual IP of the server.
- **Enter your display name**: This name will be prefixed to your messages in the chat.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand **socket programming**, **multithreading**, and **real-time communication** in Java.
